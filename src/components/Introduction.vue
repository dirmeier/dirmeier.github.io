          Hello, welcome to my website. I am a computer scientist who went freelance
          to have more time for developing open-source software and
          doing some research on machine learning methods.
          <br>
          My expertise and scientific interests lie broadly in probabilistic machine/deep learning,
          (nonparametric) Bayesian statistics, causal inference and probabilistic programming.
