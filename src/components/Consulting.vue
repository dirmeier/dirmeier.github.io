          statistical/causal data analysis, e.g., of biomedical, financial, or
          astrophysical data sets
        </li>
        <li>development of web dashboards for visualization</li>
        <li>implementation of bespoke probabilistic models using PPLs (*)</li>
        <li>Bayesian workflow, model validation, model selection, etc.</li>
        <li>
          implementation of computational pipelines (e.g., of analysis workflows
          for reproducible research)
        </li>
      </ul>
      (*) via, e.g, Stan, NumPyro or TensorFlow Probability (in Python, Julia, C++ or R) <br />
