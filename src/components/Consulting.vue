  <h2>Consulting</h2>
    <p>
    I am occasionally available for statistical consulting on probabilistic modeling, causal inference and implementation of
    (deep) probabilistic models using programming languages, particularly
    <ul>
      <li>statistical/causal data analysis, e.g., of biomedical, financial, or astrophysical data sets</li>
      <li>implementation of (deep) probabilistic models using the frameworks Stan or Tensorflow Probability (in R or Python) </li>
      <li>debugging and optimization of probabilistic models</li>
      <li>development of dashboards to visualize results of a data analysis</li>
      <li>assistance with questions about Bayesian model validation, model selection, etc.</li>
    </ul>
