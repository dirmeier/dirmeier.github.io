      Hello and welcome. I am Simon, a machine learning scientist with a
      Bayesian faible. Currently, I am working as a senior data scientist at the
      <a href="https://datascience.ch/">Swiss Data Science Center</a> in the
      academic cell. Apart from that, I enjoy spending my time developing
      open-source software and writing <a href="/case-studies">case studies</a>.
      I also occasionally offer
      <a href="/about#consulting">statistical consulting</a>.
