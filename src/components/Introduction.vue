    Hello and welcome. I am Simon, a freelance machine learning scientist from Munich. Currently,
    I spend most of my time developing open-source software and doing
    research, in particular on probabilistic machine/deep learning, causal inference and probabilistic programming.
    Along the same lines, I also write <a href="/case-studies">case studies</a> and
    occasionally offer <a href="/consulting">statistical consulting</a>.
