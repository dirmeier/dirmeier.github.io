    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
    I am a freelance machine learning scientist with a background in computer
    science and applied statistic. My professional and scientific interests revolve a
    <i>probabilistic (Bayesian) machine learning</i> (PML), i.e., a family of methods and models that uses probability theory
    to describe and manipulate uncertainty and that epistemologically interprets probability as degree of belief
    (in comparison to the historically more prevalent interpretation as frequency).

    PML is both theoretically and practically appealing because a) Bayesian decision theory offers a clear description
    to reason under uncertainty and draw (scientific) conclusions and b)
    it inherently entails exciting computational inferential problems. The latter has in recent years
    brought my attention to <i>probabilistic programming</i> which uses computer programs to represent probabilistic models
    and automatically infers quantities of interest (usually posterior distributions).

    My doctoral studies focused on development of machine learning and statistical methods for the analysis
    of genetic interventional data (ETHZ, Switzerland). Before moving to Switzerland,
    I have studied bioinformatics and computer science with a focus on graph theory, machine learning and software engineering
    (TU/LMU Munich, Germany).

      I am enthusiastic about probabilistic programming in general, and the
      languages <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a> and
      <a href="https://num.pyro.ai/en/latest/index.html">NumPyro</a>
      in particular.
