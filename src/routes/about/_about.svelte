	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>
		I am a machine learning scientist based in Zurich, Switzerland. I currently work as a senior
		data scientist at the
		<a href="https://datascience.ch/">Swiss Data Science Center</a>
		in the academic cell. My expertise and scientific interests lie broadly in probabilistic machine
		learning, causal inference, Bayesian statistics, and probabilistic programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've conducted my doctoral studies at
		<a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETHZ</a> in Switzerland, where I developed statistical methods
		for the analysis of genetic interventional data. Before that, I have studied computer science
		and bioinformatics at
		<a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">TU</a>/<a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html">LMU</a>
		in Munich, Germany (and seven semesters of philosophy at LMU).
	</p>
	<p>
		As a computer scientist turned applied statistician, I am particularly enthusiastic about
		probabilistic programming which, as a discipline, lies at the interface of both fields.
		Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) use computer programs to represent probabilistic
		models and are able to automatically infer quantities of interest (usually posterior
		distributions) without users needing to manually implement samplers or optimizers. In that line
		of research, I frequently contribute to modern PPLs, e.g., the frameworks
		<a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a> or
		<a href="https://num.pyro.ai/en/latest/index.html">NumPyro</a>, to learn more about
		computational and mathematical nuances of methods. As a former researcher in computational
		biology and wannabe-philosopher, I am keen on causal inference (CI) due to its relatedness to
		philosophy of science, epistemology and scientific discovery, and since it mathematically
		formalizes how (and if) cause-and-effect relationships can be established (CI concerns itself
		with the discovery and inference of cause-and-effect relationships).

	<p>
		I interact with computers mainly via Python, JavaScript and C++, but recently also have begun
		developing software in Clojure and Julia. For ML, my tech stack consists of Stan, NumPyro and
		Deepmind's <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/using-jax-to-accelerate-our-research"
			>JAX ecosystem</a
		> (e.g., JAX, Haiku, Distrax, Optax, ...). I am an advocate of open science, reproducible research
		and principled coding practices, and employ tools such as Docker and computational pipelines, like
		Snakemake, for robust data analysis. Other than that, I have some experience with high-performance
		and cloud computing, e.g., via OpenMP, GPGPU (CUDA) and Azure/Google Cloud.
