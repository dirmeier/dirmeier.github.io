      Hello and welcome. I am Simon, a freelance machine learning scientist.
      Currently, I spend most of my time developing open-source software and
      doing research, in particular on probabilistic machine learning and
      probabilistic programming. Along the same lines, I also write
      <a href="/case-studies">case studies</a> and occasionally offer
      <a href="/about#consulting">statistical consulting</a>.
