    I am occasionally available for statistical consulting on probabilistic modeling, causal inference,
     and research software development. In particular, I offer consulting on
    <ul>
      <li>statistical/causal data analysis, e.g., of biomedical, financial, or astrophysical data sets</li>
      <li>development of web dashboards for visualization</li>
      <li>implementation of bespoke probabilistic models using PPLs (*)</li>
      <li>Bayesian workflow, model validation, model selection, etc.</li>
      <li>implementation of computational pipelines (e.g., of analysis workflows for reproducible research)</li>
    </ul>
      (*) via Stan, NumPyro or TensorFlow Probability (in R or Python) <br>
