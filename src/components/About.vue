    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a freelance machine learning (ML) scientist based in Zurich,
      Switzerland. My expertise and scientific interests lie broadly in
      probabilistic machine learning, causal inference, Bayesian statistics, and
      probabilistic programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've conducted my doctoral studies at
      <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETHZ</a> in Switzerland, where I
      developed statistical methods for the analysis of genetic interventional
      data. Before that, I have studied bioinformatics and computer science at
      <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">TU</a>/<a
        href="https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html"
        >LMU</a
      >
      in Munich, Germany (and seven semesters philosophy at LMU).

      As a computer scientist turned applied statistician, I am particularly
      enthusiastic about probabilistic programming which, as a discipline, lies
      at the interface of both fields. Probabilistic programming languages
      (PPLs) use computer programs to represent probabilistic models and are
      designed such that inference of quantities of interest (usually posterior
      distributions) can be automatized. In that line of research, I frequently contribute to
      modern PPLs, e.g., the frameworks
      <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a> or
      <a href="https://num.pyro.ai/en/latest/index.html">NumPyro</a> to learn
      more about the computational and mathematical nuances. As a former
      researcher in computational biology and wannabe-philosopher, I am keen on
      causal inference (CI) and its relationship to metaphysics, epistemology,
      and scientific discovery (CI concerns itself with the discovery and inference cause-and-effect
      relationships).

      I interact with computers mainly via Python, R and C++, but recently also
      have begun developing in Clojure and Julia. For ML, my tech stack of choice consists of Stan, Jax, NumPyro and TensorFlow (Probability). I am
      an advocate of open science, reproducible research and principled coding practices, and employ tools
      such as Docker and computational pipelines, like Snakemake, for robust data analysis.
      Other than that, I have (limited) experience with high-performance and cloud computing, e.g., via
       OpenMP, GPGPU (CUDA) and Azure/Google Cloud.
