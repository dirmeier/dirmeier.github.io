    My expertise and scientific interests lie broadly in probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian statistics, causal inference and probabilistic programming. 
    I have studied bioinformatics and computer science at TU and LMU Munich, before I've moved to Switzerland to conduct my doctoral studies on statistical modelling of genetic interventions at ETH, for which I developed and applied probabilistic (graphical) models for the analysis of genetic interventional data.

    I am enthusiastic about probabilistic programming in general, and the languages Stan and Tensorflow Probability in particular. I gladly help out with questions/problems/issues related to statistical modelling and building Stan and TFP programs, so please feel free to reach out!
    I am available for statistical consulting on probabilistic modelling and causal inference,
    including

      Hello, welcome to my website. I am Simon, a computer scientist who went
      freelance to have more time for developing open-source software and doing
      some research on machine learning methods.
      <br />
      My expertise and scientific interests lie broadly in probabilistic machine
      and deep learning, (nonparametric) Bayesian statistics and causal
      inference. <br />
