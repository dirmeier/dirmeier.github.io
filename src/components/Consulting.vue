    My expertise and scientific interests lie broadly in probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian statistics, causal inference and probabilistic programming.
    I have studied bioinformatics and computer science at TU and LMU Munich, before I've moved to Switzerland to conduct my doctoral studies on statistical modelling of genetic interventions at ETH, for which I developed and applied probabilistic (graphical) models for the analysis of genetic interventional data.

    I am enthusiastic about probabilistic programming in general, and the languages Stan and Tensorflow Probability in particular. I gladly help out with questions/problems/issues related to statistical modelling and building Stan and TFP programs, so please feel free to reach out!
    I am available for statistical consulting on probabilistic modelling and causal inference,

      Hello, welcome to my website. I am Simon, a computer scientist who went
      freelance to have more time for developing open-source software and doing
      some research on machine learning methods.
      <br />
      My expertise and scientific interests lie broadly in probabilistic machine
      and deep learning, (nonparametric) Bayesian statistics and causal
      inference. <br />


      I am a machine learning scientist with a background in computer
      science and applied statistics. My expertise and scientific interests
      lie broadly in probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian statistics,
      causal inference and probabilistic programming. I have studied
      bioinformatics and computer science at TU and LMU Munich, before I've
      moved to Switzerland to conduct my doctoral studies on
      <i>statistical modelling of genetic interventions</i> at
      <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH</a>, for which I developed and
      applied probabilistic (graphical) models for the analysis of genetic
      interventional data.

      <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/"

      in particular. I gladly help out with questions/problems/issues
      related to statistical modelling and building Stan, TFP or NumPyro
      programs, so please feel free to reach out!

      In my free time I play the guitar, like reading philosophy, work on
      extending my Jazz collection, and enjoy contributing to machine
      learning and stats related open-source software.
