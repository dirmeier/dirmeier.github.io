      Hello and welcome. I am Simon, a freelance machine learning scientist
      based in Switzerland. Currently, I spend most of my time developing
      open-source software and doing research, in particular on probabilistic
      machine learning, causal inference and probabilistic programming.
      Along the same lines, I also write
      <a href="/case-studies">case studies</a> and occasionally offer
      <a href="/consulting">statistical consulting</a>.
