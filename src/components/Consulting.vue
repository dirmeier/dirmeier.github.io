      Hello, welcome to my website. I am Simon, a computer scientist who went
      freelance to have more time for developing open-source software and doing
      some research on machine learning methods.
      <br />
      My expertise and scientific interests lie broadly in probabilistic machine
      and deep learning, (nonparametric) Bayesian statistics and causal
      inference.<br />

      I am particularly enthusiastic about <i>probablistic programming</i> which
      are probabilistic I offer statistical consulting for probabilistic
      modeling
